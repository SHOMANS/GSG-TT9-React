 - Update the Counter component to take onIncrement and onDecrement callbacks as props and ensure they update the counter's values independently. 

 - Each callback should take a single, integer value as a parameter, which is the amount to increment the counter's existing value by.

 - Render a fourth Counter component and ensure its value is updated independently of the others.

 - Extra Credit: Create a Total component, which should display below the Counter components and always display the running total of all the Counter values.

Note: DON'T USE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT!, USE CLASS COMPONENT AND ITS STATE.
